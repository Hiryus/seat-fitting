## Quick Installation:

In your seat directory (By default:  /var/www/seat), type the following:

```
php artisan down
composer require denngarr/seat-fitting

php artisan vendor:publish --force --all

```

And now, when you log into 'Seat', you should see a 'Fittings' link on the left.

Good luck, and Happy Hunting!!  o7
